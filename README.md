## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
- Animations

### What I learned

Overall, in this challenge I wanted to focus more on the JS portion, so I didn't really pay much attention to make my SCSS effective. Despite that, I was having some problems with logic on the dynamic styles. It took me more time than I would like but I guess it's important that I finished it.

### Useful resources

- [SASS guidelines](sass-guidelin.es) - Really helpful in learning Sass and SCSS current practices.
- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - An awesome CSS Reset.
